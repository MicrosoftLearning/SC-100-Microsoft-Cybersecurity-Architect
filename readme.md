# SC-100: Microsoft Cybersecurity Expert

This repository includes lab instructions for **SC-100: Microsoft Cybersecurity Expert**.  The labs assume access to a preconfigured M365 E5 tenant and a separate preconfigured Azure subscription provided by the ALH.  Depending on the ALH, you may see these labs organized into separate activities (topics), such as Identity, Security, and Governance, Risk, & Compliance. Lab instructions may be run on a user's own Microsoft 365 tenant and Azure subscription, but are not guaranteed, as some features may not be enabled with a user's personal subscription.

The user interfaces (UI) for Microsoft 365 and Azure are continually being updated.  As these changes happen every effort is made to ensure lab steps are updated to reflect changes, but it is not uncommon to see variances in the UI described in the labs and the actual tenant.

## What are we doing?

- To support this course, we will need to make frequent updates to the course content to keep it current with the Azure and Microsoft 365 services used in the course.  We are publishing the lab instructions and lab files on GitHub to allow for open contributions between the course authors and MCTs to keep the content current with changes in Azure and Microsoft 365.

- We hope that this brings a sense of collaboration to the labs like we've never had before - when Azure or Microsoft 365 changes and you find it first during a live delivery, go ahead and make an enhancement right in the lab source.  Help your fellow MCTs.

## How do I contribute?

- Any MCT can submit a pull request to the code or content in the GitHub repo, Microsoft and the course author will triage and include content and lab code changes as needed.

- You can submit bugs, changes, improvement and ideas.
